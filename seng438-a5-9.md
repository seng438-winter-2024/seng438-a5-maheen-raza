# Introduction

For our fifth and final assignment, we are provided with different failure reports, that we are expected to convert into different types of graphs in order to understand the overall reliability and failure data of the given system. The main purpose of this assignment is to get a deeper understanding of different reliability assessment tools. Through this lab, we are meant to dive into the following ways to assess the given data:

1. Reliability Growth Testing
2. Assessment with Reliability Demonstration Chart

Through part 1 of the assignment, we are expected to understand the important of reliability growth testing, and why certain plots like time-between-failures and failure-count plots are important in determining the overall system reliability.

In part 2 of the assignment, we are expected to understand how MTTF is relevant in terms of testing, and are also expected to become comfortable with tools that implement RDC.

### Failure Report 2 Using SRTAT:

In order to decipher failure report 2, in terms of model selection, I only worked with the "Geometric" and "Littlewood and Varral's Bayesian Reliability" models, as the rest of the models would not execute or work on my laptop, so these two models are the ones I decided to select. When looking at these two models, the following conclusions can be made:

Geometric Model:
- The geometric model assume that software failures tend to occur randomly, essentially following a geometric distribution, as indicated by the name.
- The geometric model also tends to be the easiest to understand and implement.

Littlewood and Varral's Bayesian Reliability Model:
- This model assume that software faults tend to occur randomly, and also considers factors like fault removal rates and testing effots.
- Tends to give us a more realistic view on our failure data.

Above, I used excel in order to plot the failure intensity graph, using the chapter 10 slides from lecture as reference. In order to graph the plot, I used the "failure time" column in the failure report 2 word document as the "cumulative time between failures" data on the x-axis, and calculated the "failure per second" as error number over the the failure time in order to get data for the y-axis. Based on this graph, as time progresses, the failures that occur per second starts to drop, indicating a potential increase in system reliability, as there aren't a lot of failures occurs that were occuring originally.

For the plot above, I also used excel in order to graph the time-between-failures graph, by using the "failure number" column in failure report 2 as the x-axis, and the "time since last failure" column as the y-axis. Based on the peaks of this graph, this indicates that as the number of failures increase, the time between them starts to increase. For example, the peak at error 50 indicates that approxmiately 4000 seconds passed before error 50 occured from the last error that occured. This also indicates a potentially reliable system, as the overall uptime and availability of the system increases when the time between the failures increases, as the system is up for longer before the next failure occurs.

In the above graph, I used the SRTAT Reliability tool to plot the reliability growth analysis plot. In order to generate the plot above, I first took all of the data under the "Time Since Last Failure" column and put it into a text file, which I then fed into the SRTAT tool, and used the littlewood model to generate the above graph, as the geometric model would not generate a graph, and would cause my laptop to just load. In the above graph, the prediction line indicates that as time progresses, the overall reliability of our system grows, as the time between the failures grow. Looking at the raw data, the scattered points start to grow upward as time progresses, also verifying the upward trend of our data.
