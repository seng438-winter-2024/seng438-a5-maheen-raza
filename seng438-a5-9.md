# Introduction

For our fifth and final assignment, we are provided with different failure reports, that we are expected to convert into different types of graphs in order to understand the overall reliability and failure data of the given system. The main purpose of this assignment is to get a deeper understanding of different reliability assessment tools. Through this lab, we are meant to dive into the following ways to assess the given data:

1. Reliability Growth Testing
2. Assessment with Reliability Demonstration Chart

Through part 1 of the assignment, we are expected to understand the important of reliability growth testing, and why certain plots like time-between-failures and failure-count plots are important in determining the overall system reliability.

In part 2 of the assignment, we are expected to understand how MTTF is relevant in terms of testing, and are also expected to become comfortable with tools that implement RDC.
